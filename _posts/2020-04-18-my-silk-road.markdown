_TL:DR_   
I'm learning Mandarin Chinese and this is my journey. Expect a series of blog posts

I've always had a passion for languages. I remember when I was maybe 7 or 8 I created a "language". I put language in quotation marks because it closer resembled a different form of PygLatin with random words thrown in too. I was quiet naive in that sense, especially considering we were still at quite basic stages of learning Irish which I did not enjoy one bit. I only really began to enjoy Irish for one year when I was 14-15 years old and the last two years is where it has sprouted with me and I take joy out of every part of it, even voluntarily reading "Peig"! Maybe the allure of languages was more so that fact that they seemed strange, foreign, exotic, unattainable. Then also insert the compulsory nudge and allusion to the Irish education system blah blah not even going to touch on that, that is an article upon itself.    

I've gotten to the point with my Irish learning that the only issue for me getting to a C1 (CEFR) is the quantity of Irish vocabulary I know and I am familiar enough with to understand in conversation or be able to use.  
As for my Russian then I am at an okay stage of it where I would be able to read a newspaper with a bit of help but I am just coming out of a Russian module I have completed in college so I would prefer to talk it easy from here.  
However the one constant language that has been niggling away at the back of my mind, that I have look at longingly for years has been Mandarin Chinese. If my desire to learn languages is a plot where x is exoticness and y is my desire to learn the language then Mandarin would be the at the farthest reaches of that plot. Maybe my idea for putting it upon a pedestal is due to the West treating China as an _"other"_, for the worse I would say. In recent years China has only grown in importance to now challenging the United States' hegemony on the international stage. Everyday you see scathing articles attacking China, some with serious yellow peril and xenophobic undertones that need to be addressed. There is a sense of fear in the West of losing control and dominance but that is to be expected when 1.4 billion people with a high level of education and lots of disposable income flood onto the scene.  
Now it is more important than ever to learn Mandarin as it will undoubtedly play a significant role in the future of Earth and beyond.

To plot my journey I must first lay out where I am starting from, the origin of my self assessed graph. Right now I have no idea about characters or how to write them. I know one character that `人` is a person but I don't know the pronunciation. To build on that I don't know how to speak any Chinese except `nĭ hăo`. My knowledge of tones consists of me knowing of their existence. I could try to pronounce them but most likely fail. So I would be classed as an absolute beginner.  

In terms of a plan going forward I can draw on my experience with learning Russian from the beginning and possibly also my skills learning a higher standard of Irish. In later blog posts reporting back with the results of the various apps and methods I used I can detail my experiences and feelings but for now I can simply set out a plan, a very rough one at that. I could try to take some form of HSK1 test to find my level but I know it will return 0 so I can just set that as terra firma.  
My plan is to use youtube tutorials and apps such as "Lingodeer" to practice my pronunciation of the tones, initials, words, etc. Once I have the pronunciation to a decent beginner level I can tackle Anki flashcards without burning bad behaviours into my mind.  
Anki is an app that I have had a lot of success with in the past and spaced repetition is something that I have at first hand seen the successes of and the fruits that my labour yielded. I have read into the work of Stephen Krashen in second language acquisition and the importance of comprehensible input, I even included a section on it in my final year thesis, but for now at the beginner stage that benefit is reduced due but I hope to include it more as I ramp up.

I do still have summer exams approaching but after that I will be able to focus on my Chinese learning and keep track of any statistics, notes or methods to publish any results in future.
